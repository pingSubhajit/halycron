			<div className="mt-10 space-y-4">
				<p className="font-medium text-base">Why?</p>
				<p className="text-sm opacity-60 leading-normal">I believe that privacy is not a privilege — it’s a
					right. In an age where our memories are scattered across the cloud, buried in algorithms, and
					vulnerable to
					prying eyes, we’ve lost control over what should be ours alone. Halycron was born from the
					frustration of not having a truly private space for our most personal moments. Existing solutions
					promise security but come with compromises: hidden terms, backdoors, or the uneasy feeling that your
					data is never entirely yours.</p>
				<p className="text-sm opacity-60 leading-normal">I built Halycron for those who want peace of mind, not
					just convenience. A place where your photos stay locked away unless you decide otherwise. A place
					where trust isn’t assumed but proven through encryption, protection, and control. Every image you
					store here is yours—untouched, untracked, and inaccessible to anyone but you. Because privacy isn’t
					something you should have to ask for. It should be the default.</p>
